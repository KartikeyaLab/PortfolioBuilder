🧩 Step 1: Prepare Your Website Files

Before anything else:
	•	Make sure your website has:
	•	A main file called index.html
	•	Any other files: CSS, images, JS etc.
	•	All files should be in one folder.

🔁 Tip: test the site locally by opening index.html in your browser — it should work without a server.

🧱 Step 2: Create a GitHub Account (Skip if you have one)
	1.	Go to https://github.com
	2.	Sign up or log in.
	3.	Confirm your email address.

⸻

🗂 Step 3: Create a New GitHub Repository
	1.	Go to https://github.com
	2.	Click the ➕ icon on the top-right corner → “New repository”
	3.	Fill these fields:
	•	Repository name: something like my-website
	•	Description: optional
	•	Public repository ✔️ (required for GitHub Pages to work)
	4.	Do NOT initialize with a README, .gitignore, or license (leave unchecked)
	5.	Click “Create repository”

⸻

⬆️ Step 4: Upload Your Website Files
	1.	You’ll be on the new repo page.
	2.	Click the button “uploading an existing file” (or just drag & drop files).
	3.	Drag your entire website folder contents (not the folder itself) into the upload box.
	•	Make sure index.html is in the root.
	4.	Scroll down and:
	•	Add a commit message (e.g. “Initial upload”)
	•	Click “Commit changes”

✅ Your files are now in your repository.

⸻

🚀 Step 5: Enable GitHub Pages
	1.	In your repo, click the ⚙️ “Settings” tab (top right, not the user settings)
	2.	In the left menu, click “Pages” (or scroll down to “Pages” under Code and Automation)
	3.	Under “Source”:
	•	Choose: “Deploy from a branch”
	•	Then select:
	•	Branch: main
	•	Folder: / (root)
	4.	Click “Save”

🌍 After a few seconds, you’ll see:

Your site is live at https://yourusername.github.io/your-repo-name/

Click that link to open your live website!

🕒 It can take ~1 minute to show up the first time.

⸻

🧪 Step 6: Test and Share
	1.	Open the URL in a new browser tab to confirm it works.
	2.	If something’s broken:
	•	Check file paths (e.g.  should match folder structure)
	•	Reload the page with hard refresh (Shift + Reload)

⸻

🔁 Bonus: How to Update the Site

To update your site later:
	1.	Go to your repo
	2.	Click “Add file” → “Upload files”
	3.	Upload your new/edited files
	4.	Scroll down, add a commit message, and click “Commit changes”

Your GitHub Pages site will auto-update within seconds.

⸻

✅ That’s it! You’ve published your website with GitHub Pages using only the web interface.
